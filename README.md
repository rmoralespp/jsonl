## About

**jsonl** is a lightweight Python library designed to simplify working with JSON Lines data, adhering to
the [JSON Lines format](https://jsonlines.org/).

### Features

- üåé Provides an API similar to Python's standard `json` module.
- üöÄ Supports custom serialization/deserialization callbacks, with the standard `json` module as the default.
- üóúÔ∏è Supports compression and decompression using `gzip`, `bzip2`, and `xz` formats.
- üîß Can load files with broken lines, skipping any malformed entries.
- üì¶ Includes an easy-to-use utility for writing to multiple JSON Lines files.

## Installation

To install **jsonl** using `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install py-jsonl
```

## Getting Started

**Dumping data to a JSON Lines File**

Use `jsonl.dump` to incrementally write an iterable of dictionaries to a JSON Lines file:

```python
import jsonl

data = [
    {"name": "Gilbert", "wins": [["straight", "7‚ô£"], ["one pair", "10‚ô•"]]},
    {"name": "May", "wins": []},
]

jsonl.dump(data, "file.jsonl")
```

**Loading data from a JSON Lines File**

Use `jsonl.load` to incrementally load a JSON Lines file into an iterable of objects:

```python
import jsonl

iterable = jsonl.load("file.jsonl")
print(tuple(iterable))
```

**Dumping data to Multiple JSON Lines Files**

Use `jsonl.dump_fork` to incrementally write structured data to multiple **.jsonl** files‚Äîone per key (in this case, player name). 
This helps organize and efficiently store data for separate entities.
This example creates individual JSON Lines files for each player, storing their respective wins.

```python
import jsonl


def generate_win_data():
    """Yield player wins data for multiple players."""

    data = (
        {
            "name": "Gilbert",
            "wins": [
                {"hand": "straight", "card": "7‚ô£"},
                {"hand": "one pair", "card": "10‚ô•"},
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "May",
            "wins": [
                {"hand": "two pair", "card": "9‚ô†"},
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Gilbert",
            "wins": [
                {"hand": "three of a kind", "card": "A‚ô¶"},
            ]
        }
    )
    for player in data:
        name = player["name"]
        yield (f"{name}.jsonl", player["wins"])


# Write the generated data to files in JSON Lines format
jsonl.dump_fork(generate_win_data())
```
